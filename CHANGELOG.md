## [1.0.10] - 2025-06-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Critical**: Fixed support for ODT, ODP, ODS, and JSON file formats
  - Added missing format extensions to supported formats list
  - Resolves "Unsupported file type" error for these formats
  - Format processing strategies were already implemented but not accessible

### 📋 Technical Details
- Added `odt`, `odp`, `ods`, `json` to the `supported` array in FileToJsonNode
- All format handlers were previously implemented in the `strategies` object
- This was a configuration oversight that prevented format recognition

### 🎯 Impact
- Users can now successfully process OpenDocument formats (ODT, ODP, ODS)
